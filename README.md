## About Me

Hello! I am So Ra Chung, a former retail worker turned into software developer in training. I'm currently attending [Nashville Software School](https://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/), a very cool coding bootcamp, where I am enrolled in the web development program, specifically for full stack, where we learn HTML, CSS, JS, and React.JS in the front end and C#, .NET and ASP.NET MVC in the back end. Most of my public repos are work from this program. Feel free to look around!
